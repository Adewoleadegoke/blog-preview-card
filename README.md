## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

I learnt about the box-shadow property in css


```css
.main-component {
  box-shadow: 8px 8px;
}
```

I also discovered that images with .svg extension tend to have certain problems when the height is changed

### Continued development
I will focus more on my structuring of elements.
